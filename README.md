# Hello, I'm Chichi 👋

I'm a frontend web developer with 4 years of experience, primarily working with Vue2 and SVN. 

Outside of work, I've self-studied React and Next.js, and I've also learned backend technologies like NestJS. 

In my spare time, I studied for and passed the AWS Developer Associate exam.

Additionally, I have a passion for new technologies and have been learning about Web3. 

I started learning English from scratch and can now communicate effectively. 

My goal is to find a remote job, and I believe that learning English will help me achieve this goal.
