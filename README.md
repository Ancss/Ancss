# Hello, I'm Chichi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend web developer with 4 years of experience, primarily working with **Vue2** and SVN. 

Outside of work, I've self-studied React and **Next.js**, and I've also learned backend technologies like **Nest.js**. 

In my spare time, I studied for and **passed the AWS Developer Associate exam**.

Additionally, I have a passion for new technologies and have been learning about Web3.
